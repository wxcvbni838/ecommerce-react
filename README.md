## Features

- User authentication with JWT
- Product management
- Shopping cart functionality
- Order processing
- Admin dashboard for managing products and orders
- Real-time data monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus
- Scalable architecture using Docker and Kubernetes

## Technologies Used

This project employs a variety of technologies to ensure performance and scalability:

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Golang with Gin Gonic
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Storage**: MinIO
- **Web Server**: Nginx
- **Monitoring**: Grafana and Prometheus
- **API Documentation**: Swagger
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Installation

To get started with the Ecommerce React project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wxcvbni838/ecommerce-react.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ecommerce-react
   ```

3. Set up the backend:
   - Navigate to the backend folder:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     go mod tidy
     ```

4. Set up the frontend:
   - Navigate to the frontend folder:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```
   - Install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

5. Create a `.env` file in both backend and frontend folders to configure your environment variables. You can refer to the `.env.example` files for guidance.

6. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

7. Start the frontend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now you can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can explore the following features:

- **User Registration and Login**: Create an account or log in to your existing account.
- **Browse Products**: View the available products in the store.
- **Add to Cart**: Add products to your shopping cart for purchase.
- **Checkout**: Complete your purchase through a secure checkout process.
- **Admin Dashboard**: If you log in as an admin, you can manage products and view orders.

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation, you can refer to the Swagger UI. Once the backend server is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`.

## Architecture

The Ecommerce React project follows a clean architecture approach, separating concerns and ensuring maintainability. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the architecture:

- **Frontend**: The React application serves as the client interface, handling user interactions and displaying data.
- **Backend**: The Golang server processes requests, interacts with the database, and serves API endpoints.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL stores user data, product information, and order details.
- **Caching**: Redis is used for caching frequently accessed data, improving performance.
- **File Storage**: MinIO serves as an object storage solution for product images and other files.
- **Monitoring**: Grafana and Prometheus are integrated for real-time monitoring of application performance.

- **Pattern Detection**: Detects and warns against common patterns and repeated characters

The password strength meter provides real-time feedback with color-coded indicators:
- ðŸ”´ **Very Weak** (0-19): Red
- ðŸŸ  **Weak** (20-39): Orange  
- ðŸŸ¡ **Fair** (40-59): Yellow
- ðŸ”µ **Good** (60-79): Blue
- ðŸŸ¢ **Strong** (80-89): Green
- ðŸ’š **Very Strong** (90-100): Emerald
